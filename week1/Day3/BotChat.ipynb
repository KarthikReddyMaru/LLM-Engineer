    "### Step 1: Ollama Has Two Different Endpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "Ollama has two ways to talk to it:[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`/api/generate`** - For simple, one-time text generation[2][1]\n",
    "2. **`/api/chat`** - For proper conversations with message history[1][2]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: How Each Endpoint Handles Your Messages\n",
    "\n",
    "When you send messages to Ollama, they need to be converted into text that the model understands. Here's where the difference matters:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using `/api/generate` (what `ollama/` does):\n",
    "\n",
    "Your messages:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are helpful\"}\n",
    "{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Get converted into ONE BIG TEXT STRING like this:[1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "### System:\n",
    "You are helpful\n",
    "\n",
    "### User:\n",
    "Hello\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assistant:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The model literally sees \"### System:\", \"### User:\", etc. as **part of the text**.[3][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using `/api/chat` (what `ollama_chat/` does):\n",
    "\n",
    "Your messages stay as **structured data**:[4][1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n",
    "You are helpful\n",
    "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n",
    "Hello\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These special tags (`<|start_header_id|>`) are **invisible to the model**—they just tell it \"this is a system message\" or \"this is a user message\" [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Why \"### User:\" and \"### Assistant:\" Appear\n",
    "\n",
    "When using `/api/generate` (with `ollama/`), the model sees this pattern in its input:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### System:\n",
    "...instructions...\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assistant:\n",
    "Hi there!\n",
    "\n",
    "### User:\n",
    "Hello\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assistant:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The model thinks: \"Oh, I see a pattern! The conversation uses ### User: and ### Assistant: labels. I should continue in the same style!\"[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "So when it generates a response, **it sometimes includes these labels** because it thinks they're part of the conversation format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Visual Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "**What happens with `ollama/llama3.2`:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input to model:  \"### System:\\n...### User:\\nHello\\n### Assistant:\\n\"\n",
    "Model thinks:    \"I see these labels, I'll use them too\"\n",
    "Output:          \"### User:\\nWhat's up?\\n### Assistant:\\nNot much!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What happens with `ollama_chat/llama3.2`:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input to model:  <hidden role tags> Hello <hidden role tags>\n",
    "Model thinks:    \"Just a normal conversation\"\n",
    "Output:          \"Not much, how are you?\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: The Simple Fix\n",
    "\n",
    "Change from:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "OLLAMA_MODEL = 'ollama/llama3.2'  # Uses /api/generate - includes labels\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "OLLAMA_MODEL = 'ollama_chat/llama3.2'  # Uses /api/chat - no labels\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This tells LiteLLM to use the proper chat endpoint that understands message roles natively."
